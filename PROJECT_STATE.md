# Project State

## Current milestone

Phase 3A - Spark runtime and 10,000-record input design complete; execution approval pending.

## Current status

- `AGENTS.md` is the active repository instruction file.
- Git has been initialized on the `main` branch.
- The initial controlled foundation has been preserved through Git.
- Python 3.12.10 is installed and available.
- Eclipse Temurin OpenJDK 17.0.20 is installed and `JAVA_HOME` is configured.
- Docker Desktop 4.84.0 and Docker Engine 29.6.2 are operational.
- Docker Compose 5.3.1 and the WSL2 Linux backend are available.
- A NASA FIRMS API key has been obtained; the secret remains outside Git.
- A standard-library bounded NASA FIRMS extractor is implemented.
- Eleven extraction tests pass.
- A live 21-record NASA NRT extraction reconciled successfully.
- Deterministic version 1 source identity and canonical event transformation are implemented.
- Twenty automated extraction and canonicalization tests pass.
- All 21 verified NASA rows canonicalized successfully with unique stable identities.
- A repeat canonicalization produced byte-identical canonical event output.
- No dependencies have been installed.
- Local NASA source and generated event data remain excluded from Git.
- No AWS resources have been created.
- Spark dependency research selected PySpark 4.0.2 for parity with the target `emr-spark-8.0.0` runtime.
- The deterministic Standard Processing acquisition and exact 10,000-record selection contract is documented.

## Approved mission

Build a professional batch and streaming data-engineering platform that processes approximately 10 million NASA-derived event messages using clearly distinguished original NASA records, enriched records, replay events, and synthetic scale-test records.

## Current gate

Phase 3A research and design are complete. Owner approval is required before creating the project virtual environment, installing PySpark 4.0.2, acquiring the bounded global Standard Processing input, or implementing the Spark batch slice.

## Next proposed milestone

Phase 3B - install the approved pinned Spark dependency, run a local Spark compatibility smoke test, acquire and deterministically select the 10,000-record input, then stop for gate evidence review before the Bronze-to-Silver implementation.

## Known constraints

- The laptop has 16 GB RAM; Docker currently has approximately 7.6 GB available.
- The project workspace is on a mechanical D: drive, so Spark shuffle and file-heavy operations may be slower.
- The 5-million and 10-million execution environments will be chosen from measured earlier-gate results.
- AWS deployment is prohibited until the local 10,000-record vertical slice passes.
- Major dependencies require approval before installation.
- The verified live extraction contains 21 original NASA records and is not a scale-gate result.
- Near-real-time NASA data may later be superseded by standard-processing data.
- The Python canonicalizer is intentionally bounded; distributed scale processing will use Spark DataFrame APIs.

## Integrity reminder

The project must never describe all 10 million processed event messages as original NASA observations.
